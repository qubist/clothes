# Clothing hanger

## Units
.dxf file units: millimeters I think
.svg units: inches
Should be around 15 inches across

## Construction
Cut out of plywood with lasercutter. They should tile pretty well to be able to print out a bunch without wasting too much material. The width of the part is 7 mm, so if you cut out of 7 mm plywood (1/3" or 1/4") the arms should be approximately square.
